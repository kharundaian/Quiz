General knowladge quiz

Hi there, 
I did a general knowladge quiz, which asks some questions, checks if the answers are correct. At the end of the quiz it shows how many correct answers you got out of the total amount of questions. Also it shows you the answers of wrong answered questions. It' my opinion that it can be used in schools to measure students' general knowledge. While writing the codes I tried to make it readable and clear. I know that it would be better if the questions were a bit harder and I could have added "D" or even "E" options.
